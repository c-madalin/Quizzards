## üöÄ Features

### üìö Interactive Document-Based Learning
Upload your learning materials (PDFs, documents) and interact with them through an AI-powered chat interface. Ask questions about your documents and get intelligent answers based on the content.

### üß† Adaptive Question Learning Environment
Practice with questions that adapt to your knowledge level. If you answer incorrectly, Quizzard adjusts and provides additional questions until you master the concept. This creates a personalized learning path for each student.

### üìù Custom Quiz Generation for Educators
Teachers can quickly generate custom quizzes based on specific topics, choosing from multiple question formats:
- Multiple choice questions
- Single choice questions
- True/False questions

## üß© System Architecture

Quizzard consists of two main components:

1. **RAG System (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**:
   - Document ingestion and processing
   - Vector embedding for semantic search
   - Context-based question answering

## üí° The Idea Behind Quizzard

Quizzard was born from the need to make learning more accessible and personalized. Traditional educational approaches often follow a one-size-fits-all model, but we believe that AI can transform education by:

1. **Personalizing the learning experience** through adaptive questioning
2. **Reducing teacher workload** by automating quiz creation
3. **Making study materials more interactive** through conversational AI

Our solution brings advanced AI capabilities into the classroom in an accessible way, helping both students and educators get more from their educational materials.
