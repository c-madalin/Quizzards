Test: TrueFalse on Inequality
Number of questions: 5

----------------------------------------

1. The standard of living in a society is primarily determined by the average level of consumption or income. (False) - We are concerned not simply with the average, but also its distribution among households.

2. A society with a higher average income but greater inequality enjoys a lower standard of living compared to one with a lower average income but less inequality. (False) - The answer depends on a value-based judgement and there is often a trade-off between level and inequality, so the answer depends on how large the differences are.

3. The economic boom of the past 20 years has not affected income distribution significantly. (False) - Discussion about its effect on income distribution suggests that the share of total income going to the highest income groups increased dramatically during this period.

4. Evidently, the economic boom raised both the average income and the inequality of distribution, but it is better to have a higher average even if it means greater inequality because it is only temporary. (False) - The text does not state that the greater inequality is only temporary, related to the boom.

5. Income inequality is a topic that will occupy decreasing attention in the years ahead. (False) - There is no doubt that it will occupy increasing attention in the years ahead.
